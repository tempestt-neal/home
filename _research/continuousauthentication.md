# Project Summary
Current software for user authentication relies on the user to directly initiate some interaction (i.e., active authentication). However, active authentication systems are not accessible to individuals across all
age groups. Continuous authentication schemes transparently observe a user's natural multimodal behaviors to leverage all possible signals as input for authentication, and hence do not require explicit
authentication interactions to be initiated by the user, and are thus a promising framework for authentication by individuals of different age groups. This project's novelties are 1) to advance understanding of
how individuals of different age groups use and perceive existing authentication methods, especially concerning users' mental models and acceptance of monitoring for the purposes of continuous
authentication, and 2) to collect and analyze a variety of user signals in multiple behavioral and physiological modalities for age-aware continuous authentication on personal computing devices. This research
also informs the design of continuous authentication interactions in other contexts such as public spaces and other smart environments, in which continuous authentication might be useful. The research
includes three phases. (1) Elicit the mental models multi-generational users have of what it means to authenticate to a system, if and when they expect the system to re-authenticate them to confirm their
identity as they continue to interact, and if and how they expect to receive feedback of authentication attempts. (2) Produce a novel dataset of behavioral and physiological data, such as touch gestures,
keystroke dynamics, heart-rate variability, and skin temperature, through a series of data collection sessions wherein individuals of different age groups will be recruited to complete a diverse set of tasks. (3)
Develop fundamental knowledge of age-aware continuous authentication through the analysis of these data using state-of-the-art machine and deep learning techniques.

This project is a collaboration between the CIBeR Lab, the Affective Vision Lab (https://scanavan.github.io/), the Intelligent Natural Interaction Technology Lab (http://init.cise.ufl.edu/), and the Ruiz Human-
Computer Interaction Lab (https://ruizlab.org/).

# This project received Research Experience for Teachers and Undergraduates supplements through the U.S. National Science Foundation to engage with undergraduate students on the development of high school cybersecurity teaching materials. 

This summer project, spanning approximately three months, aimed to develop threat modeling scenarios that are relatable to high school students to personalize their learning of Identity and Access Management (IAM) technologies. The project design included group brainstorming to identify threat scenarios most suitable for classroom instruction that appeal to students’ everyday contexts. Specifically, we aimed to identify threat and attack scenarios that students may regularly face (or are familiar with) related to IAM, like password attacks through shoulder surfing from a classmate or use of biometrics on smartphones. Our hypothesis was that by personalizing learning in this way, student engagement and learning will be positively impacted, as opposed to relying on existing teaching strategies that do not produce consistently positive learning outcomes.

This study was approved by USF's Institutional Review Board as Study #005606, and was funded by NSF's Secure and Trustworthy Cyberspace Program, Grant #2039373.

## Proposed Research Questions

### Brainstorming Session 1:
1. What is threat modeling?
2. Can threat modeling be useful for teaching cybersecurity?
3. How can personalizing the threat scenarios be useful?
4. How can we personalize learning scenarios?
5. How might students respond to personalized threat scenarios?
6. How would personalized threat scenarios promote learning?
7. What would be the likely takeaway messages by students when using personalized threat scenarios to teach cybersecurity?

### Brainstorming Session 2:
1. Which scenarios are suitable for classroom instruction, and why?
2. Are these scenarios truly relatable?
3. What makes scenarios relatable, including the media of presentation (e.g., online content, images, videos, slide decks, music, etc.).
4. Which assessments/rubrics should be used for measuring learning?
5. What are the potential limitations?
6. What are the potential benefits?
7. What should be improved?

### Final Focus Group:
1. Which scenarios are most promising for classroom instruction?
2. If adapting personalized threat modeling for teaching cybersecurity concepts, what should teachers focus on during lesson planning?
3. In what cases would this approach be most and least appropriate?
4. Would this approach to teaching IAM work for other cybersecurity topics?

## Research Background
Threat modeling is a process that allows us to identify and understand security threats [12]. By modeling threats, we gain a better sense of how to attack or defend a given system. In terms of teaching cybersecurity, threat modeling provides a way for teachers to give students a real-life scenario to engage with.

With the rise of technology, as well as the ethical considerations that come along with it, teachers are having to explain cybersecurity and other related topics to their students [4]. Unfortunately, there is strong evidence to suggest that teachers are having a hard time implementing this curriculum into their classes [2, 3, 4]. Teachers in the Killhoffer study were noted to be worried about a perceived gap in knowledge when faced with the tech-savvy nature of their students, regardless of if this divide was real or not. The Childers study revealed that teachers didn’t feel comfortable in their abilities to create an engaging lesson about cybersecurity, even after they had undergone the professional development course.

The consensus, among teachers and parents, is that it’s important to educate students on these topics [3], but there are differing views over how it should actually be done. Whether it should be game based [6, 7, 10], a hands-on simulation activity (like a lab or project) [5, 8, 9, 11], or just some sort of engaging learning experience [2, 4]. Furthermore, most of these studies take place as a summer program, rather than being implemented within the school system itself [5, 6, 8, 10], or are just tested in the classroom for a short period of time [7]. Even though student enjoyment was had a statistically significant increase with these programs, without knowing how their learning is impacted in the long-term it’s difficult to accurately evaluate the activity’s worth.

This project takes into consideration the student aspect of the cybersecurity learning scenario. We consider the preconceived notions that high-school students might have about cybersecurity and Internet safety, and how we can better adapt the lessons to be more engaging and relatable. We also have them generate their own ideas for activities, which allows them to come up with ideas that other students might be eager to participate in.
