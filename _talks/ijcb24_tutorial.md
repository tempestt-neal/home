## Abstract
Qualitative research is a method of inquiry aimed at gaining a deep understanding of social phenomena by relying on individuals' direct experiences. Unlike quantitative research, which seeks to quantify variables and analyze numerical data, qualitative research emphasizes the exploration of complex, subjective experiences, meanings, and social dynamics. 

Qualitative exploration can greatly enhance the field of biometrics by offering deep insights into complex issues like bias in biometric systems and user acceptability. These methods allow for a more detailed understanding of how these systems are perceived and experienced, which is crucial for addressing ethical concerns and improving overall effectiveness. However, qualitative research design involves more than simply talking to people; it requires established strategies for systematically collecting, organizing, and interpreting data to understand people's perspectives and experiences. This process demands proper researcher training and practice.

This tutorial aims to provide biometrics researchers with a foundational understanding of qualitative research methods and their applicability to the field. This proposed half-day tutorial will cover foundational qualitative research concepts and their specific applications to biometrics. We will review qualitative research methodologies such as interviews, focus groups, case studies, and ethnographic studies. 

The tutorial will address qualitative research design, including formulating research questions and hypotheses, selecting appropriate qualitative methods, sampling strategies for participant recruitment, and data collection techniques such as conducting and recording interviews, managing focus groups, and employing observational methods. Additionally, we will cover data analysis methods, including coding qualitative data, thematic analysis for identifying patterns and themes, and grounded theory for theory development. Ethical considerations in qualitative research, particularly regarding informed consent, confidentiality, and privacy in the context of biometric data, will also be discussed. We will explore how qualitative methods can enhance the understanding of user experiences related to biometric research, examine the social and cultural implications of biometric technologies, and investigate usability and acceptance across various contexts.

## Targeted Audience
The expected target audience includes individuals (i.e., faculty, students, system and UX designers, industry professionals, etc.) engaged in biometric research or related fields who are interested in:

1. Understanding the application of qualitative research techniques within biometric studies.
2. Gathering user perspectives and experiences.
3. Improving biometric systems based on user feedback and qualitative insights.

## Prerequisites for the Participants
No prerequisites are required for attendees. However, a general understanding of biometric technologies and their applications, along with a genuine interest in the intersection of biometrics and user experience, as well as the ethical and social implications of biometric technologies, will help participants engage more deeply with the content.
