## Abstract
Qualitative research is a method of inquiry aimed at gaining a deep understanding of social phenomena by relying on individuals' direct experiences. Unlike quantitative research, which seeks to quantify variables and analyze numerical data, qualitative research emphasizes the exploration of complex, subjective experiences, meanings, and social dynamics. 

Qualitative exploration can greatly enhance the field of biometrics by offering deep insights into complex issues like bias in biometric systems and user acceptability. These methods allow for a more detailed understanding of how these systems are perceived and experienced, which is crucial for addressing ethical concerns and improving overall effectiveness. However, qualitative research design involves more than simply talking to people; it requires established strategies for systematically collecting, organizing, and interpreting data to understand people's perspectives and experiences. This process demands proper researcher training and practice.

This talk aims to provide biometrics researchers with a foundational understanding of qualitative research methods and their applicability to the field. It covers foundational qualitative research concepts and their specific applications to biometrics. We will review qualitative research methodologies such as interviews, focus groups, case studies, and ethnographic studies. 

The talk will address qualitative research design, including formulating research questions and hypotheses, selecting appropriate qualitative methods, sampling strategies for participant recruitment, and data collection techniques such as conducting and recording interviews, managing focus groups, and employing observational methods. Additionally, we will cover data analysis methods, including coding qualitative data, thematic analysis for identifying patterns and themes, and grounded theory for theory development. Ethical considerations in qualitative research, particularly regarding informed consent, confidentiality, and privacy in the context of biometric data, will also be discussed. We will explore how qualitative methods can enhance the understanding of user experiences related to biometric research, examine the social and cultural implications of biometric technologies, and investigate usability and acceptance across various contexts.
