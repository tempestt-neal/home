Tempestt Neal is an Associate Professor of [Computer Science and Engineering](www.cse.usf.edu) at the [University of South Florida](www.usf.edu). She leads the Cyber Identity and Behavior Research (CIBeR) Lab, which primarily conducts quantitative and qualitative research on mobile-based sensing for biometrics and human behavior understanding in interdisplinary applications, as well as cybersecurity awareness among populations historically underrepresented in Science and Engineering. The lab's research also spans [natural language processing](https://nlp-grp.github.io/), mostly including the study of linguistic cues as a cognitive biometric trait, as well as implicit opinion mining tasks. 

She holds a Ph.D. from the University of Florida (Computer Engineering, 2018), M.S. from Clemson University (Computer Science, 2014), and a B.S. from South Carolina State University (Computer Science with a minor in Mathematics, 2012). Dr. Neal has served as an Associate Editor for the IEEE Biometrics Council Newsletter and Guest Editor for the MDPI Electronics Special Issue on Recent Advances in Biometric Security in IoT Based on Machine Learning. She has also served on the organizing committee for several workshops in Artificial Intelligence and Biometrics, including the Workshops on Applied Multimodal Affect Recognition (AMAR 2020, AMAR 2021, AMAR 2022) and the Workshop on Interdisciplinary Applications of Identity Science and Biometrics. She was a recipient of the University of Florida Delores Auzenne Dissertation Award and National Science Foundation CyberCorps Scholarship for Service Fellowship. She was also recognized as a 2021-2022 McKnight Junior Faculty Fellow, and received an NSF CAREER Award in 2023.
